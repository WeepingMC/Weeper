# Weeper - Relaxed like weed and stable like Paper  #
## What ##
Weeper is a fork of Paper.

It contains many gameplay changes to suit our server, but more importantly, contains new performance improvements pending
testing to be contributed to Spigot / Sponge.

We also have many API's that we privately use but choose to not publicly PR them upstream, see below for why.

## Why we don't release all API ##
API's are tough to design. In public projects such as Bukkit, Spigot, Sponge etc, once an API is commited. It's almost
forever. You can't go breaking it without solid justification. This is the politics game.

With that in mind, much thought has to be given to the API in now and future use cases and applications to ensure it can
be extended without breaking.

This is a lot of politics that we don't have time in our lives to deal with.

Therefor, we write API's to OUR base needs, which is often not 'complete' or 'up to style guidelines' of upstream repositories.
We do not have the time to write code that we personally do not need for these API's.

We also want to retain the ability to make breaking changes to the API if it results in a better way to do things or
performance improvements.

By contributing it upstream, we would give up that power.

So that is why we have many extremely useful API's that are not PR'd upstream

## LICENSE / Support / Usage of Patches ##
All patches written that has been included inside of Wheeper
are licensed MIT, and are free to be used in your own fork.

We offer ABSOLUTELY NO SUPPORT for these patches. If you wish to use them, you must take the effect to extract them
from our repo, apply them to your own, and repair any code changes to get it to compile (note: we use a .callEvent()
utility method on the Event class for nearly all Custom Events to reduce diff.)

If we make a breaking change, and you wish to pull the patch to update it after that, it's your job to fix the changes!

So in summary, we love to share! Use anything we wrote in this repo how ever you please, but support it yourself :)


## OS Support / Scripts##
We only directly support Ubuntu 14.04 for the shell scripts. It may work elsewhere... but no promises.

Many scripts will try to push to our repo's, please change that if you fork :)

### scripts/importmcdev ###
Imports specific files from mc-dev that CB/Spigot doesn't use but we need.

### scripts/updatespigot ###
updates the Bukkit/CraftBukkit/Spigot baseline when passed --update, otherwise regenerates the baseline with changes
to mcdev from importmcdev

Run `scripts/applypatches` then `scripts/rebuildpatches` immediately after

### scripts/generatesources ###
Generates an mc-dev folder that can be added to IDE for the other mc-dev files located in minecraft-server.jar

### scripts/rebuildpatches ###
Rebuilds patch state from the Wheeper-* repo's current state. Automatically handles patch deletion and renaming
for you unlike Spigots version of these scripts.

### scripts/applypatches ###
Takes current patches/{bukkit,craftbukkit} and applys them on latest spigot upstream
